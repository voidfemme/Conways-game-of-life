# Conway's Game of Life

There are several versions here, because I'm inexperienced with GitHub. The working
version is `life3.cc`. I've also made a `print_grid.cc` which is my rough draft of an
`ncurses` implementation.

## Installation:
(I don't know how to use a Makefile for now, so....)
Basically just compile main.cc with the ncurses flag, and it should produce a binary no problem
